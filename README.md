## 📌 Overview  
**AR-Based Visualization of Atoms & Molecules** is an **Augmented Reality (AR) educational tool** that enhances chemistry learning by visualizing **3D atomic and molecular structures** in real-world environments. The project leverages **Vuforia & Unity** to provide an interactive learning experience, helping students and researchers **better understand molecular compositions, chemical bonds, and atomic arrangements.**  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **3D Visualization** – View molecules & atomic structures in **interactive AR**.  
✅ **Marker-Based Tracking** – Uses **printed QR codes** or **molecule images** for real-time rendering.  
✅ **Educational Mode** – Displays **chemical properties, bond types, and molecular mass**.  
✅ **User Interaction** – **Rotate, zoom, and explore** molecules in 3D.  
✅ **Android Compatible** – Runs on **Android devices**.

## 🔬 Technologies Used  
- **Unity 3D** – Game engine for AR development  
- **Vuforia** – Augmented reality framework  
- **C# Programming** – Core scripting for AR interactions  
- **Blender** – Used for designing 3D molecular models  
- **OpenAi API** - Chatbot platform integration

## 🛠 How It Works  
1️⃣ **Open the App** – Launch the AR-based molecule visualizer.  
2️⃣ **Scan a Marker** – Point your camera at a **QR code** or **chemical formula image**.  
3️⃣ **View in AR** – The **3D molecular structure** appears in real-time.  
4️⃣ **Interact** – zoom,drag and get **detailed information** about the molecule.  

### **Installation Steps:**  
1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**  
   First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:  
   
   git clone https://github.com/jmy744/AR_Based_Visualization_of_Atoms_and_Molecules.git
   cd AR_Based_Visualization_of_Atoms_and_Molecules

2️⃣ **Open the Project in Unity**

Open Unity Hub and select Open Project.
Navigate to the folder where the repository was cloned and select the project.

3️⃣ **Install Vuforia SDK for Unity**

Go to Vuforia Developer Portal: Vuforia SDK Download and download the SDK for Unity.
Import the Vuforia SDK into Unity by selecting Assets > Import Package > Custom Package and selecting the Vuforia SDK package.

4️⃣ Enable Vuforia in Unity

Go to Edit > Project Settings > Player.
In the XR Settings section, check the Vuforia Augmented Reality box to enable it in Unity.
Make sure Vuforia is set up under Player > Other Settings for the app to work on mobile.

5️⃣ **Add Vuforia License Key**

Go to the Vuforia Developer Portal and create a new license key.
Add this key in Unity under Vuforia Configuration (you can find this in the Player Settings).

6️⃣ **Set up AR Camera**

Replace the main camera in your scene with the AR Camera provided by Vuforia.
Make sure the Vuforia Behaviour is attached to the AR Camera.

7️⃣ **Build and Run on Android**

Connect your Android device to your computer.
In Unity, select File > Build Settings and choose Android as the platform.
Click Build and Run to deploy the app to your device for testing.

📖 **Research & Future Enhancements**
📌 Research Focus: The project investigates how AR can enhance chemistry education. AR can assist in visualizing complex scientific concepts like molecules and atoms, increasing engagement and comprehension.

🔹 AI Integration – Future versions may include AI for molecule recognition.
🔹 Voice Assistance – Add voice-guided explanations of molecular structures.
🔹 More Molecule Models – Expand the database to include complex organic & inorganic molecules.
